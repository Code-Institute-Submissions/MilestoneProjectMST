# Miscellaneous Sole Trader
# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
I have chosen to use my own idea to build a website for Miscellaneous Sole Trader as milestone project. Because, I own this business which need a website to grow outside Amazon and eBay support. Having own website opens some more windows for business where business appears to be independent and confident.


With this project I would like to build a user-friendly website which can be clutter free and easy to understand look of the website. My plan is to keep basic interface which is familiar to user and place all the options within this interface.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Fontawesome
5. Google Fonts
6. Wireframe
7. ScreenToGif (2.18)

## UX
My website is for online business which is already established online with help of Amazon and eBay. With this website I will try to bring all my customer over where they can find all the products they need with larger and more clearer images. Now-a-days, there are millions product in the market with similar name or identical look, which makes very harder for customer to find the product they need.


Keeping this basic scenario in my mind I have decided to keep images larger compare to content. Also, having many buttons and links will confuse customer, that is why I have kept images as main selling point.

### How would I find description of the product.
Under every product image there is product identifier or name, right next to it there is “i” icon. In Desktop mode customer can hover over to get description while for touch functionality devices customer simply tap on it to appear and tap within tooltip 

### How can I buy a product?
Click on product image which you like to buy where it will provide you with pop up on which there is link to Amazon and eBay to complete buying process.

### How can I visit Instagram page
All social media links are located right at the bottom of the page within footer section where you can find Instagram logo. Clicking on Instagram logo will take you to Instagram page.

### Wireframe
To design this website, I have created a design using Wireframe technology which can be found on Github link as follows:


https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/hidayatmansuri.github.io/tree/master/MST_Wireframe


## Features
Most of the website menu bar is embedded within nav bar on top of the website which can only be accessed by reaching on top of the website can be frustrating. To come over this issue I have kept menu bar floating on top left corner of the website which can be access from anywhere on website. For screen size over 1200-pixel menu background will be transparent for modern look. For smaller device there will be menu background matching header colour to avoid menu options getting lost within contain of the website particularly for Delivery and About Us pages.


Moreover, menu options will be highlighted with different colour depends on which page customer surfing on. Such as, if customer is on About Us page, About Us option in menu will be in orange colour.

### Demo for Menu

To have clutter free website, I have embedded every product in button. People are used to with clicking on images for more information, I have linked every button with a Modal functionality from Bootstrap to provide customer with a message for buying options. For information or description about every product I have created Tooltip linked with ‘i’ icon next to product name.

Previously, I had same functionality with hover over on buttons, which was not compatible with touchscreen functionality devices.  To come over this issue I have decided to add little ‘i’ icon for description which is compatible for all types of devices.

I have activated all the links for marketplaces and social media. Links with marketplace will take customers to Amazon and eBay, where they can make payment and choose from more products. While with social media links will take customer to our social media pages for activities we carry out and can follow for future updates.

### Feature left to Implement
I will be adding payment feature in future where customer can complete their order solely on website.


Contact Us form is in function but submitting form will refresh form rather than sending data. For full form functionality I need to gain knowledge.

### Demo for Contact Us page

In future there will home or landing page will be added too which will be linked to company logo.

## Testing
I have tested this project on number of devices (iPhone5, iPhoneX, HTC U12+, One Plus One, Pocophone, Samsung s20e, Samsung Tablet, iPad, Honor 7) as well as on desktop I have used majority of web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, IE10, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi).


Some of Android devices had issue with background image zooming in, which was sorted with media query.


I preferred menu with transparent background for modern look, but that was not feasible for small devices where menu options were getting disappeared in content of website. To resolve this issue, I have created media query where any devices with under 1200 pixel will have background colour for menu options.


Also, floating menu icon was small round for minimal design, but it was barely visible on smaller devices which was pointed out by one of my friend while testing. To resolve this issue, I have decided to make menu icon bit bigger and brighter with well-known burger bar icon.


Footer which is same for all pages have all the marketplace and social media links which are activated except Twitter which yet to be activated. All links are opening the relevant pages in new tab as required and will be highlighted as and when hover over in the desktop mode. For touch functionality device it requires tapping on.


About US and Delivery pages are only containing information about company and services.


Contact Us page have required fields for customer to get in touch with company related to products or order(s). Within the form there are some mandatory fields which needs to be filled with required information before submitting or jumping on next field.

## Deployment
I have deployed this project on GitHub through AWS Cloud9 using its command base terminal functionality, where it resides under MilestoneProjectMST repositories.


Also, I have deployed this project using GitHub desktop application. Where application have created a folder in which all files related project should be stored. Any changes made on the files stored within this folder will be picked by application, which needs to be commit and push to GitHub. This project resides under hidayatmansuri.github.io repository


Both of these methods stored data on same place under my account but one is command base application while another one is desktop application.

### Command base

### Desktop Application
With this method few clicks will upload and move your data on required place or server
