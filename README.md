# "Miscellaneous Sole Trader"
# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
I have chosen this project to build a website using my own idea, because I own a business which needs a website as well as I have content and access to all areas of business which required to build a website

## Technologies
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (4.3.1)
Fontawesome
Google Fonts

## UX
In modern world competition is harsh and if you don't stay ahead with latest design and technique, there is very high chances for any business to get lost in grey clouds of poor vision. That is why I have decided to build a website with very clean and easy to understand design.

My goal to have user-friendly website with easy to find option. That is why I have left burger bar icon positioned on left hand side with fix position, which can be access from any page or position. Moreover, I have kept Header and Footer with minimum information to have clutter free look on any size of device. I have kept all four pages separate due to nature of business where information need to be changed quite frequently, which could effect other areas or information too.

## Features
All images on product page have been blended in buttons, which customers can click-on to buy as well as have used Tooltips functionality to provide description about each product.

## Features Left to Implements
I will be adding more products on website in future with payment functionality as well as through contact page customer would be able to get in touch with me regarding any query they have. There will be option(s) of sorting products in ascending, descending and catagory wise. Price will be added nearer to going live.

## Testing
To provide best customer buying experience, I have decided to keep same design for all devices without compromising design and look of the website.

I have kept burger bar on fix location for all devices for minimal design which is replaced with Mizuni logo from Fontawesome. This bar will be available at any position and page to navigate between pages without scrolling up to get access to it.

On small devices products will be shown in either two columns or in a single column depends on device size. As I have mentioned above all the products have been blended in button with little note on top of the page saying “Click on IMAGE to Buy”. On click, I have created a Modal with Information and guide for customer, where there are eBay and Amazon links activated and will guide customer to related marketplace for complete their purchase.

I did used Tooltip for buttons, where on desktop website it would have provided information about product as and when customer hover over button. But unfortunately, it wasn’t identical for small and touch functionality devices.

To come over that issue, I have provided with small “i” icon next to each product name. This icon will provide description for each product when hover-over in desktop mode, while with touch functionality devices customer can tap on "i" icon to have full description of the product and click within tooltip will disappear the Tooltip.

Contact Us page have full form by which, customer can contact me with question or query they have related to product or order. Functionality on pressing Send button would not work as I have to gain knowledge to make that functionality working. Some Social Media link will have same issue where clicking on icon will open website in new tab. I have activated link for Facebook and Instagram, which will take customer on our related social media page.

This website was tested on different devices and web browsers where there was no issue was found
