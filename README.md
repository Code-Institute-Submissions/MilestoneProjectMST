# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - "Miscellaneous Sole Trader"

I have chosen this project to build a website using my own idea, because I own a business which needs a website as well as I have content and access to all areas of business which required to build a website

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Fontawesome
5. Google Fonts

## UX
In modern world competition is harsh and if you don't stay ahead with latest design and technique, there is very high chances for any business to get lost. That is why I have decided to build a website with very clean and easy to understand design.
My goal to have user-friendly website with easy to find option. That is why I have left burger bar icon positioned on left hand side with fix position, which can be access from any page or position. Moreover, I have kept Header and Footer with minimum information to have clutter free look on sizes of device. I have kept all four pages separate due to nature of business where information can be changed as and when required without effecting other areas or information.

## Features
All images on product page has been blended in buttons, which customers can click to buy as well as have used Tooltips functionality to provide description about each product.

### Features Left to Implements
I will be adding more products on website in future with payment functionality as well as through contact page customer would be able to get in touch with us regarding any query they have. Also, Social Media and direct link to Amazon and eBay will added for customer to provide them with more buying options.

## Testing
To provide best customer buying experience, I have decided to keep same design from all devices without compromising design and look of the website.

I have kept burger bar on fix location for all devices for minimal design which is replaced with Mizuni logo from Fontawesome. This bar will be available at any position and page for navigation one page to other without scrolling up to get access to it.

On small devices products will be shown in either two columns or a in a single column depends on device size. As I have mentioned above all the products have been blended in button with note on top saying “Click on IMAGE to Buy”. On click I have created a Modal with Information and guide for customer as full functionality is not available at present.

I did used Tooltip for buttons, where on desktop website it would have provided information about product as and when they hover over button. But unfortunately, it wasn’t identical small and devices with touch functionality.

To come over that issue, I have provided with small “i” icon next to each product name. This icon will provide description regards to each product when hover over while in desktop mode, while with touch functionality devices customer can tap on it have full description of the product.

Contact Us page have full form by which, customer can contact me with question or query they have related to product or order. Functionality on pressing Send button would not work as I have to gain knowledge to make that functionality working. Social Media link will have same issue where on clicking on link will open website in new tab.

This website was tested on different devices and web browsers where there was no issue was found
